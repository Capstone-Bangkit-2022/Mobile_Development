# Classifying the trash into four common recyclable and degradable items such as plastic bottle, soda can, paper wrap, and food waste (Garbag).

As the pandemic continues online shopping has already become one of our favorite lifestyles. Food comes with packaging whether it's plastic, metal, or even paper. Once we finish our meals, this packaging has no value, so we treat them as useless beings, worthy to be discarded, regardless of their types. As the trash keeps piling up, recycling, one the methods we use to address the problem becomes harder as the trash is not placed into one container. Humans have the ability to separate things better than computers or robots. So by helping humans to know better about the value of their trash, we hope we could help the trash bank when it comes to collecting recyclable items.

Many inventors have already made designs such as automatic sorting machines that are able to differentiate between metal and plastic using sensors and machine learning models that could classify organic and non-organic trash. By using the previous design we could later enhance the performance of the latter by adding new features. The final project application would be able to differentiate between four items, plastic, metal, paper, and organic trash then give information about its value and what to do to the user. By giving such information we hope that the user would separate their trash, so that would help the process of recycling.
